# React Static Comp

### Specification
The React static comp is designed to get you comfortable with basic React principles and to keep up your CSS skills.

### Things to note
- All of the assets are provided in the repo
- You will be tasked with writing JSX, passing props, and writing some CSS
- We haven't provided any breakpoints or designs:
  - You will need to write them yourself ...
  - including editing the `index.html` to include the proper meta tags

### Base Requirements
- Basic React site set up with provided repo
- Create a repo on github :octocat: for your work with following naming construct: `[initials]-react-static-comp`
  - (i.e. `lk-react-static-comp`)
- Include a README with the repo that provides
  * a brief overview of the project
  * images of both the original comp and your version
  * a reflection on what was challenging, any lightbulb moments you had, and your biggest takeaways
- Stretch goal: Comp should be fully responsive
- Stretch goal: Push your final work to github pages (you will have to run a build and push the main.bundle.js file to github)


### Additional Requirements
- This challenge will be a part of your mod 2 portfolio
